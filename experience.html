            <h2>Work Term 1 - BI Analyst @ Lafarge Canada Inc.</h2>
            <h3>May 2024 - August 2024</h3>
            <p>Over the past four months, I’ve had the pleasure of working at Lafarge Canada in the Data Integration and Transformation department as a Business Intelligence Analyst. During this time, I’ve worked on a variety of projects that have sharpened my programming and problem-solving skills. My experience at Lafarge has also given me valuable exposure to the Materials and Construction industry. I’ve gained a deeper understanding of their products, such as aggregates and concrete, through site visits to the Dundas quarry in Hamilton and the Innovation Lab in Toronto.</p>
            
            <h3>Projects</h3>

            </div>

            <p>Throughout my term, I’ve had the opportunity to work on different projects with different tools such as Google Apps Script, Google AppSheet, and Looker Studio. My first project I was introduced to was a data normalization task where I had to normalize historic report data for the site visits of concrete plants. I utilized Google App Script to develop a script which would take all the historic data from the CSV file it was stored in and then normalize each row of data and link it with a master key. This project helped me improve my problem solving skills since I had to develop an algorithm to dynamically assign keys in order to normalize the data. This solution enabled us to process over 2,000 records across multiple sheets, significantly improving data consistency and eliminating manual intervention. By ensuring a clear data structure, I helped the team retrieve information more efficiently and generate more accurate reports.</p>

            <p>The second project I worked on was automating the Concrete Plant Safety Checklist. I developed two scripts using Google Apps Script to automate the verification process for daily and monthly safety checklists across concrete plants in Eastern Canada. These scripts ensured compliance by sending timely reminder emails to concrete batchers when checklists were not submitted on time. Additionally, I implemented escalation notifications that alerted supervisors and managers if submissions were not completed within two days. This automation significantly improved operational efficiency and accountability within the plant's workflow, ensuring consistent adherence to safety protocols. Through this project, I leveraged skills in Google Apps Script, workflow automation, and workplace safety.</p>
            <p>The third scripting project I am working on is still in progress and it is a multi-use document processing script that leverages the help of Google’s Gemini API. Since Lafarge is the largest manufacturer of building materials in Canada, they receive lots of external testing results from third party companies that test their products. Each company has a different format for their reports and since there are quite a few testing companies there needs to be a dynamic way to process these reports in a timely manner. So far I have developed a custom Google Apps Script to automate the extraction and processing of test result data from PDF documents using Google's Gemini API and OCR technology. Parsed the JSON output into structured arrays and automated the insertion of data into Google Sheets, streamlining data entry and improving accuracy for over 3,000 documents. This project introduced me to the concept of REST APIs and has helped me better understand how to integrate different technical tools together. This project also helped me learn how to navigate complex and limited documentation and implement effective solutions.</p>

            <h3>Site Visits</h3>

            </div>
            <p>In June I had the opportunity to visit Lafarge’s Dundas quarry, which is the largest aggregate quarry in Canada. This main product of the site is limestone which is blasted and then sent to the crusher which then grinds the stone into different sizes which are then used in different construction projects. Visiting the site taught me a lot about Lafarge and helped me understand the business better. In July I visited Lafarge’s innovation and training center (ITC) in Toronto. At the ITC lab Lafarge designs and tests new concrete mixes which eventually make their way onto our roads and buildings. My visits to the sites allowed me to see a side of the business that I have never been exposed to and allowed me to gain a broader perspective on how other people work. My visits to the sites also makes it much easier to generate ideas that could help improve the workflow of colleagues who work on site. These visits have been integral to helping me understand the business.</p>

            <h3>Reflections - WT1</h3>
            <p>My time at Lafarge Canada has been an invaluable learning experience, both professionally and personally. I’ve had the opportunity to immerse myself in the materials and construction industry, a field I had little knowledge of prior to this internship. Gaining insight into the processes behind products like concrete and aggregates has given me a newfound appreciation for the complexity and importance of this industry.</p>

            <p>One of the most rewarding aspects of my time at Lafarge has been the development of my interpersonal skills. Working in a professional environment has sharpened my ability to communicate clearly and collaborate effectively with team members. I've also grown more confident in working independently, taking ownership of my projects, and ensuring they meet the needs of the team.</p>
            <p>From a technical perspective, my skills have advanced significantly. I’ve had hands-on experience with tools like Google Apps Script, AppSheet, and Looker Studio, each of which has enhanced my ability to automate processes and create data-driven solutions. The exposure to these platforms has deepened my understanding of how to apply programming knowledge to real-world business challenges.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the most valuable lesson I’ve learned is the importance of designing maintainable and adaptable solutions. In contrast to university assignments, where once a project is submitted it's seldom revisited, my work at Lafarge requires me to consider long-term usability. My code must be clear, maintainable, and scalable, as I often need to revisit it for revisions or adjust it to meet evolving business requirements. This has fundamentally changed how I approach problem-solving, pushing me to think beyond immediate outcomes and focus on sustainable, long-term solutions.</p>
            <p>Overall, my experience at Lafarge has not only improved my technical and interpersonal skills but has also provided me with a deeper understanding of how to apply software engineering principles in a business context. It has been a highly rewarding chapter in my professional journey, and I’m eager to carry these lessons forward into future roles.</p>
