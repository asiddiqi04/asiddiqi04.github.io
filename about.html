            <h2>About Me!</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Adil, a Software Engineering co-op student at the University of Guelph with a passion for using technology to solve real-world problems. From a young age, I’ve always been fascinated by how things work, and I’ve always had a passion for solving problems and thinking of new solutions to problems I’ve had. This led me to pursue a career in software engineering, where I can apply my curiosity and love for innovation.</p>
            <p>Through my studies and co-op placement, I’ve gained extensive experience in software development, programming, and process automation. My role as a Business Intelligence Analyst at Lafarge Canada has allowed me to blend my technical skills with business insight, developing solutions that not only streamline operations but also drive data-driven decision-making.</p>
            <p>When I’m not coding or working on projects, I enjoy spending time playing all types of sports. Growing up I found myself on the basketball court and soccer field most of the time but recently I’ve found a passion for going to the gym and training in boxing and Muay Thai. These sports not only help me stay fit but also sharpen my focus and discipline which are traits that have been essential to my academic and professional success.</p>
            <p>In addition to staying active, I have a deep love for reading. Whether it is reading non-fiction works about the natural world or novels where I can dive into different worlds, reading helps fuel my creative thinking and helps me relax. It’s a habit that has benefited me greatly.</p>
            <p>I’m always looking for new challenges that allow me to combine my technical skills and creativity to make an impact. Whether it’s through innovative problem-solving, building efficient solutions, or continuously learning from my experiences, I’m driven by a desire to grow and contribute meaningfully. Feel free to explore my projects, and don’t hesitate to connect if you’d like to collaborate or discuss opportunities!</p>
